# Music_Ontology
***CSE488 Ontologies and the Semantic Web Project***
# Introduction
Our project is based on a Music Ontology that contains songs, their artists, including the singer
singing, the musician playing the background music, the writer that wrote the lyrics and the
composer. Our ontology also includes the bands and the artists they include, the awards won
by the artist and the instruments played by the musician. We used the Protégé ontology editor
developed by Stanford University to build our Music Ontology. Then we created a java
application and added Jena jar files to be able to create a GUI frame where we will be able to
write a SPARQL query, press execute and see the results of the query displayed in the form of
a table. We also created a JavaScript web application that contains a text field for the queries,
a button to run the query and a table to display the results.
